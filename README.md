# h2geo-presets
A list of community presets to detail specific data types for mapping parties

## What it is
Contributing to OpenStreetMap is not trivial for beginners. Sometimes, you just don't want to worry about tags, and would rather focus on what matters: data itself.
  
  h2geo-presets is a list of opensource presets, made available in the OSM Contributor marketplace and for anyone else on this repository (branch gh-pages).
  
  Want to have your next mapping party with your custom profile? Simply write your descriptor in the /presets folder and send us a Pull Request.

## How it works

  h2geo-presets parses your .yml or .json presets and automatically outputs the validated presets on the gh-pages branch.
